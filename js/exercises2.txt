1) Write a function that displays the result of 
5+6+7+8+9+10.

2) Write a function that returns the perimeter of a
rectangle with a width of 5 and a height of 8.

3) Write a function that converts 83deg fahrenheit 
to celcius.

4) Write a function that converts 30deg celcius to 
fahrenheit.

5) Write a function that calculates the total bill 
including a 25% tip on a bill of $15.84

6) Write a function that converts 45278962345 seconds to years
rounded to 1 decimal.

7) Write a function that generates a random integer (rounded number) from 1-10

8) Write a function that prints a message if 
a random number (that is generated) is 7;



9) Create an empty array
10) Push one random value into the array
11) Use a for loop to push 3 more random values 
into the array
12) Calculate the sum of the numbers in the array 
(and display it in the console)




18) Write a function that takes a number an an argument and returns the sum of each individual digit. 
So an input of 998 would return 26 (because 9 + 9 + 8) is 26. 
(Hint 1: convert to a string)
(Hint 2: use google)

19) Write a function that randomly generates an integer between 1 and 12, and returns the name 
of the corresponding month. (Hint: Look up how to get a random number in JavaScript.)

20) Write a function called isEven() that returns true if a given 
argument is even.

21) Write a function called isOdd() that returns true if a given argument is odd. Do this by only using the 
isEven() function you wrote previously.

22) Write a function that returns true if a given argument is a multiple of 3. 
Examples of multiples of 3 are 0,3,6,9 ...

23) Write a function that takes two arguments. Check if the first argument is 
a multiple of the second argument. 
Return the appropriate boolean.
Ex. checkMultiple(20, 5) returns true. checkMultiple(21,5) returns false.

24) Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and 
returns the sum of all numbers in the array

25) Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and 
returns the smallest number in the array.




26) Write a function that takes three numbers as arguments, and returns the same 3 numbers 
in ascending order in an array (more specifically, non-decreasing order if multiple numbers are the same).

27) Write a function that returns true when two inputs are equivalent when using coercion, but not equivalent 
without coercion.
Ex: isCoerced(5,"5") returns true. isCoerced(5,5) returns false. isCoerced(4,"shoe") returns false.

28) Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the reverse of that string.

29) Write a function that counts the occurences of a specific element in an array, specified as a function 
argument.
For example, for the array [5,7,12,5,3,3,5], the function countOccurences(3) would return a value of 2.

30) Write a function that returns a multidimensional array that contains number of occurences for every element 
of an array.
For example, for the array [5,7,12,5,3,3,5], the function countAllOccurences(array) would 
return: [[5,3],[7,1],[12,1],[3,2]]




31) Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an input, and returns true if the array is sorted 
in non-decreasing order. (i.e. each element in the array is less than or equal to the next element.)

32) Write a function that takes two sorted arrays of numbers as arguments, and returns one new sorted array 
containing the numbers from both of the arrays given as arguments. Call this function merge().

33) Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and sorts them in increasing order.



34) Assuming constant acceleration, a falling object's height 
can be calculated with the following equation:
y = y₀ + v₀t + (0.5gt^2)
where g = -9.8.
meters and seconds are the units
Write a function that, given some starting height, will return true
or false if the object will hit the ground after a given time (in seconds)
(Assume the object's starting velocity is 0.)

35) Write a function that will take an array of 'animal' objects as an argument 
and return the 'name' of the animal with the heaviest 'weight.'
