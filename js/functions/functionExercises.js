// think about the problem
// 1 - what are we trying to calculate/find
// 2 - name your function something related
//      to that goal
// 3 - ask yourself: What are the 'varables'
//      to this function?
// 4 - define those variables in the () of
//      the function definition 
//      (give them good names)
// 5 - keep in mind the 'return type' and
//      return your 'final answer'
