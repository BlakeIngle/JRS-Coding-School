console.log("Hello World!")

//this is a comment. the computer does not try to execute a comment
console.log("hello")//a comment

console.log(5)


console.log(5 + 3)


console.log(7 - 2)


console.log(4 * 9)


console.log(15 / 5)


console.log(14 / 9)


console.log(14.0 / 9.0)


console.log(59129034587 % 3) //what is % ????? / =/= %


// the modulo operator % is not division
// modulo is the remainder
// used for cycling events or finiding divisibility
console.log(14 % 2)


console.log(8 % 2) // % 2 is an easy way to find if a number is even or odd


a = (5 + 4)


//what does this mean ?


//we can save data to a variable. this variable 'a' has the value of 5 + 4
//so a = 9


//now we can reference the value of a (which is 9) by using a in another expression
console.log(a)
//we can even do math with a
console.log(a + 4)


//more variables
b = 9 - 3;


//now we can do whole expressions without using any literal values. Only use variables
console.log(a, b, a + b)


//now get input from the user to save in a variable


//prompt will do that for us
prompt("Enter a number:")


//we used prompt, but how do we reference the value of prompt???
