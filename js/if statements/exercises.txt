1.) 
-write some code that will generate two random numbers from 0-1
    multiply that number by 10 to get a number from 0-10
-result is two random numbers from 0-10
    call them 'a' and 'b'
-coerse 'b' into a string by concatonating the value 
    of b with an empty string

-if a and b are equivalent (with coersion ==),
    then do nothing
-if a is less than b, multiple a by 2
-if a is greater than b, subtract 3 from a

after that,
-if a < 0, multiple a by -1 (or use Math.abs())

-display the final values of a and b in the 
    following format:

a: 4
b: 3



-if a number is divisible by 2, then this expression 
    will be true:
        (n % 2) == 0

-if a is even and b is odd,
    add 1 to b
-if b is even and a is odd,
    subtract 1 from a
-if both a and b are even,
    add a and b together and assign the result 
        to a new variable called 'sum'
    then check 
        if a is less than b
            assign the value of sum to a
        or if b is less than a
            assign the value of sum to b
