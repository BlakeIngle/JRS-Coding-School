Naming Conventions:

Naming Types:

camelCase - first letter is lowercase. First letter of each subsequent word
            is capitalized. No spaces. No underscores.
CapitalCase - First letter of every word is capitalized. No spaces. No underscores.
ALL_CAPS - All letters are capitalized. Words are separated by underscores.
dash-case - all letters lowercase. Words separated by hyphen
