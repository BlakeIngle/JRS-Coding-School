    When it asks for 'What best describes your organization or needs?'

    you will get a confirmation window
    It will ask you 'What are your interested in doing with Google Cloud?'
    select 'Storage / backup' and click next

    'http://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances'
8) Click 'Create Instance'
9) Choose 'MySQL'
10) The next step will ask you to 'Enable API' -> Click 'Enable API'
    ---This will take a while---

11) You will have to define an 'instance id'
        use something that relates to the name of your project
12) You will have to create a password for the root user
        do not use a 'personal' password if other people are going 
            to use this project with you
        use a good password and write it down -> this is now 'dbPassword'

13) Change the Region to us-east1(South Carolina)

14) Click 'Create Instance' 
    --- This will take a while ---

Once that finishes, the database has been created
Next step: run your .sql script in the deployed database instance

15) Click 'Database' in the left menu
16) Click '+ Create Database'
17) Give your database a name (the name of your project is good enough)
18) Click 'Create'

19) Click Connections on the left menu
20) Click 'Add Network' to allow your personal computer/laptop to connect 
        to the database
21) Give your connection a name like 'Blake's Laptop' or something
22) Find your IP address by google searching for 'my ip'
23) Paste your IP address into the 'Network' input field
24) Click done, then click Save

25) Click Overview on the left menu
26) Find the 'Connect to this instance' tab and copy the 'public IP address'

27) Open MySQL Workbench

        to create a new connection
29) Give your connection a name and paste the IP 
        address from google cloud into the 'Hostname' input
30) Click OK

31) Click your new connection and type your 'dbPassword' 
        that we created earlier

32) After you connect then we want to execute our .sql script
        that defines our tables and data, in this instance.
33) Find your .sql script in you project files
34) Paste the contents into a new query window and execute it.
